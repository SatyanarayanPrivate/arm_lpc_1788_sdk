@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use Capture Timer function.
	Process:
		We use Timer  (0/2) to take a snapshot of the timer value when an input signal 
		on CAPx.x (pin P1.26 or P0.4) transitions.
		Timer configuration:
			- Prescaler in microsecond value
			- prescaler value = 1000000us = 1s
			- Use channel, CAPn.0
			- Enable capture both on rising and falling edge
			- Generate capture interrupt
		Whenever capture interrupt occurs, TIMER interrupt service routine will be invoke 
		to get captured time and display it into serial display
		Changing connecttion P1.26 between GND and VCC whenever want to capture time.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				Jumpers: Optional 
				Using CAPTURE_PIN P1.26 (@ J5.35) pin to enable interrupt for capturing with TIMER 0
			2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- 3.3VA_E	:ON
				- VREG		:ON
				- IO_E		:ON
				- PWR_SEL	:depends on power source selection
				- Remain jumpers: Optional
				Using CAPTURE_PIN P0.4 (EXT-4) pin to enable interrupt for capturing with TIMER 2
		(Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
				
						
		Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- UART0: USB serial port
					+ All jumpers: Default
				- UART1: 
					+ P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
					+ P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
				- UART2:
					+ JP6: 	1-2: OFF
							3-4: OFF
							5-6: ON
					+ JP12: 1-2
					+ JP13: 1-2
					+ Other jumpers: Default
				- UART3:
					+ P0.2 (@J5.13) - JP12.2
					+ P0.3 (@J5.14) - JP13.2
				- UART4:
					+ P0.22 (@J3.25) - JP12.2
					+ P2.9  (@J3.15) - JP13.2
	    	2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- UART0: 
					All jumpers: optional
			Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
			
			Setting:
				+ 115200bps 
				+ 8 data bit 
				+ No parity 
				+ 1 stop bit 
				+ No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0\1\2 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example and observe timer capture value on serial display
		Changing connection of CAPTURE_PIN between GND and VCC whenever want to capture time.
