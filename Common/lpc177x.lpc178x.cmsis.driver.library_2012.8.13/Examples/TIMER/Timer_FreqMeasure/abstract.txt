@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use Timer to measure a signal's frequency.
	Process:
		1) Initialize UART0 and display information menu.
		2) Ask user to input frequency for a test signal.
		   Configure P1.26 as CAP0.0, P0.6 as MAT2.0.
		3) Configure TIMER2 as follow:
			- Prescale register = 1 us.
			- Match register = 1 / ((frequency)*1us*2)
							 = 500000 / freuqency
			- No interrupt, no stop but reset timer counter on match.
		   Configure TIMER0 as follow:
			- Prescale register = 1 us.
			- Capture register: channel 0, capture on rising edge, generate interrupt
			on capture.
		4) Configure TIMER0 ISR:
			- Prepare 5 interrupt times, in which timer counter and prescale are reset,
			for stable.
			- After this 5 interrupt times, get the capture value, raise done flag.
		5) Start TIMER0 and TIMER2.
		   Wait for done flag, then calculate and print out the measure frequency by:
		      one cycle = capture value * 1us (as TIMER0 configuration).
		      signal frequency = 1/one cycle = 1,000,000 / capture value.
		   Press ESC if we intend to test with other frequencies.
		   TIMER0 and TIMER2 are de-initialized.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				Wired P0.6 (@ J3.18) to P1.26 (@ J5.35) for input to Timer 0 CAP0
			2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- 3.3VA_E	:ON
				- VREG		:ON
				- IO_E		:ON
				- PWR_SEL	:depends on power source selection
				Wired P0.4 to P0.10 for input to Timer 2 CAP0
		(Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)

				
		Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- UART0: USB serial port
					+ All jumpers: Default
				- UART1: 
					+ P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
					+ P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
				- UART2:
					+ JP6: 	1-2: OFF
							3-4: OFF
							5-6: ON
					+ JP12: 1-2
					+ JP13: 1-2
					+ Other jumpers: Default
				- UART3:
					+ P0.2 (@J5.13) - JP12.2
					+ P0.3 (@J5.14) - JP13.2
				- UART4:
					+ P0.22 (@J3.25) - JP12.2
					+ P2.9  (@J3.15) - JP13.2
	    	2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- UART0: 
					All jumpers: optional
			Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
			
			Setting:
				+ 115200bps 
				+ 8 data bit 
				+ No parity 
				+ 1 stop bit 
				+ No flow control   
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example
				  Use PC's terminal to select the test signal on timer capture pin
				  (P1.26 or P0.4) and see the result measured frequency printed out.
