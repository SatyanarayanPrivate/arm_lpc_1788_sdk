@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use Timer Match to generate specific time
		in interrupt mode.
	Process:
		In this case, the specific time generated is 1s.
		Timer configuration:
			- Timer channel: 0
			- Prescaler in microsecond value
			- prescaler value = 100us
		Match configuration:
			- Use channel 0, MR0
			- Match value = 10000
			Because timer tick = prescaler = 100us
			So match time = 100 * 10000 = 1000000us = 1s
			- Timer reset after match
			- Not stop MR0 when match
			- Toggle MR0.0 when match
			Because match time = 1s
			So MAT0.0 will be toggled at frequency = 1Hz
			- Generate match interrupt 
		Whenever MR0 matches the value in TC register, match interrupt is occurs, TIMER0
		will invoke interrupt service routine to handle interrupt, in this case, it will print 
		a notice sentence into serial display. MAT0.0(P1.28) toggle and timer will be reseted.
		
		Note that: print data via UART can cause delay when match time set is too small.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				Observe signal on MAT0.0(P1.28) - J5-36 pin
			2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- 3.3VA_E	:ON
				- VREG		:ON
				- IO_E		:ON
				- PWR_SEL	:depends on power source selection
		(Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
			
						
	Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- UART0: USB serial port
					+ All jumpers: Default
				- UART1: 
					+ P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
					+ P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
				- UART2:
					+ JP6: 	1-2: OFF
							3-4: OFF
							5-6: ON
					+ JP12: 1-2
					+ JP13: 1-2
					+ Other jumpers: Default
				- UART3:
					+ P0.2 (@J5.13) - JP12.2
					+ P0.3 (@J5.14) - JP13.2
				- UART4:
					+ P0.22 (@J3.25) - JP12.2
					+ P2.9  (@J3.15) - JP13.2
	    	2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- UART0: 
					All jumpers: optional
			Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
			
			Setting:
				+ 115200bps 
				+ 8 data bit 
				+ No parity 
				+ 1 stop bit 
				+ No flow control
				
						
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example and observe match interrupt notice on serial display
				  + MAT0.0(P1.28) (on PA board) signal can be observed by oscilloscope
				  + MAT2.0(P0.6) (on IAR board) signal can be observed by oscilloscope
