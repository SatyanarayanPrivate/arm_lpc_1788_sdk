@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to operate on an SD card with an file system.
		
	Process:
		Plug the card to the slot, LPC1788 will do:
        - Initialize card.
        - Read its configuration.
        - List out the structure of root directory.
        - Open a file with filename is "file_r.txt" in the root directory.
        - Create a new file with name is "file_w.txt" and then copy the content
        of file "file_r.txt" to the new file.

        This example passed with:
            -  PNY SD-MO2G.
            -  Canon SD Memory Card SDC-32M
            -  KINGMAX MMC Mobile 1GB.
            -  Micro SDHC (Class 6) 4GB.
            -  Transcend SD card 2GB.
            -  Transcend Micro SDHC (Class 4) 16GB.
		 				
@Directory contents:
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	
	fs_mci.c/.h: Create common API using MCI driver.
    monitor.c/.h: control UART0 to output on screen.
    if_lpc177x_8x.c/.h: interface for EFSL (only used in EFSL).
    efsl_main.c: Main program.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
		(Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
	
				
	Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- UART0: USB serial port
					+ All jumpers: Default
				- UART1: 
					+ P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
					+ P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
				- UART2:
					+ JP6: 	1-2: OFF
							3-4: OFF
							5-6: ON
					+ JP12: 1-2
					+ JP13: 1-2
					+ Other jumpers: Default
				- UART3:
					+ P0.2 (@J5.13) - JP12.2
					+ P0.3 (@J5.14) - JP13.2
				- UART4:
					+ P0.22 (@J3.25) - JP12.2
					+ P2.9  (@J3.15) - JP13.2
	    	2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- UART0: 
					All jumpers: optional
			Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
			
			Setting:
				+ 115200bps 
				+ 8 data bit 
				+ No parity 
				+ 1 stop bit 
				+ No flow control  
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Connect the serial connection as above for results displaying.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 4: Run example.
