@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use DMA to transfer data to DAC peripheral
	Process:
		DAC will be initialized with maximum current is 700uA. This allows a maximum update rate of 1Mhz
		Formula for ouput voltage on AOUT is: 
			AOUT = VALUE x ((Vrefp - Vrefn)/1024)+Vrefn
		in which:
		- Vrefp: tied to VDD(3.3V)
		- Vrefn: tied to Vss
		
		GPDMA channel 0 is configured in this example.
		GPDMA channel 0 will tranfer "dac_value" to DAC peripheral. DAC updated values have range 
		from 0 to 0x3FF. So AOUT ouput voltage will change from: Vss to VDD.
		
		Observe AOUT(P0.26) signal by oscilloscope.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
			2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- 3.3VA_E	:ON
				- VREG		:ON
				- IO_E		:ON
				- PWR_SEL	:depends on power source selection
		(Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
		
		DAC_OUT (AOUT-P0.26) pin:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
					+ J3.28
			2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
					+ EXT-11
				
		Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- UART0: USB serial port
					+ All jumpers: Default
				- UART1: 
					+ P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
					+ P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
				- UART2:
					+ JP6: 	1-2: OFF
							3-4: OFF
							5-6: ON
					+ JP12: 1-2
					+ JP13: 1-2
					+ Other jumpers: Default
				- UART3:
					+ P0.2 (@J5.13) - JP12.2
					+ P0.3 (@J5.14) - JP13.2
				- UART4:
					+ P0.22 (@J3.25) - JP12.2
					+ P2.9  (@J3.15) - JP13.2
	    	2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- UART0: 
					All jumpers: optional
			Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
			
			Setting:
				+ 115200bps 
				+ 8 data bit 
				+ No parity 
				+ 1 stop bit 
				+ No flow control 
				
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Run example and observe AOUT(P0.26) signal by oscilloscope
