@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to configure System Tick timer use external clock source STCLK
	Process:
		In this example, System Tick timer is clocked by external clock STCLK
		STCLK supplied by MAT0.0 (P1.28) that generated by timer match channel 0
		STCLK frequency = 50kHz
		Setting time interval = 10ms.
		After each 10ms, System Tick will generate interrupt, interrupt service routine
		'SysTick_Handler( )' will be invoke and toggle P2.10 pin.
		Use oscilloscope to observe signal on P2.10 and measure time between falling and rising 
		edge, it would be: 10ms.

	Systick_Stclk.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				Jumpers: Optional
		
		STCLK connection:
		- STCLK(P3.26) connects with MAT0.0(P1.28)
		
		Pin Map:
								PA board
			STCLK(P3.26)		J3.50
			MAT0.0(P1.28)		J5.36
					
	Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- UART0: USB serial port
					+ All jumpers: Default
				- UART1: 
					+ P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
					+ P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
				- UART2:
					+ JP6: 	1-2: OFF
							3-4: OFF
							5-6: ON
					+ JP12: 1-2
					+ JP13: 1-2
					+ Other jumpers: Default
				- UART3:
					+ P0.2 (@J5.13) - JP12.2
					+ P0.3 (@J5.14) - JP13.2
				- UART4:
					+ P0.22 (@J3.25) - JP12.2
					+ P2.9  (@J3.15) - JP13.2
	    	2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- UART0: 
					All jumpers: optional
			Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
			
			Setting:
				+ 115200bps 
				+ 8 data bit 
				+ No parity 
				+ 1 stop bit 
				+ No flow control
				
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Run example, observe System Tick operation via P2.10 signal
