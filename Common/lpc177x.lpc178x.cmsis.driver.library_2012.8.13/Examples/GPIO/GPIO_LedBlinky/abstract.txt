@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This simple program is used to test GPIO interrupt functionality to drive LED		
	Process:
		After reset, the LED1 will be blinking
		@Note: Pls reference bsp.h to know what led is used.

@Directory contents:
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	
	Gpio_LedBlinky.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
			2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- 3.3VA_E	:ON
				- VREG		:ON
				- IO_E		:ON
				- PWR_SEL	:depends on power source selection
		(Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
						
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
		
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Reset the board then we can see the LED1 blinking
		@Note: Pls reference bsp.h to know what led is used.
