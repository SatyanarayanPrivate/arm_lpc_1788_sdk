@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This is an example for IAP.
	Process:
		This sample describe how to update on-chip flash memory in the
		end user application code. Besides, it also  read the information about 
		the chip, including part id, boot code version and serial number, and 
		then show them on the terminal.

@Directory contents:
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	
	iaptest.c	   main program.
	lpc177x_8x_libcfg.h		indentify which drivers are used in the example.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				Jumper: default
			2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- 3.3VA_E	:ON
				- VREG		:ON
				- 3.3V_IO_E	:ON
				- PWR_SEL	:depends on power source selection
		(Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
	
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
		Notes: To debug, JLink version must be 4.35 or later.
		       When Ulink is used, the example can't run in RAM mode. 
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction. 
		- Step 4: Hit reset button to run example.
		- Step 6: Check the messages showed on terminal
