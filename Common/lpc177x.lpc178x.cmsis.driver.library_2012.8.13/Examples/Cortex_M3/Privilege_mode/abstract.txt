@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to change privilege to unprivilege mode and vice vesa.
	Process:
		CONTROL[0] register controls the privilege level for software execution when the 
		processor is in Thread mode. So, we can access to get/set CONTROL[0] to change Thread
		mode privilege level.
		
		Out of reset, Thread mode is privilege.
		Read CONTROL[0] to check if it is truly privilege or not.
		If Thread mode is not privilege, so it's not compliant with Cortex-M3 Technical, the 
		program will enter into infinite error loop.
		Then, set CONTROL[0] = 1, changing Thread mode to unprivilege.
		Re-check by re-read CONTROL[0] again.
		A system service will be call __SCV(). In this exception mode, we can switch back Thread 
		mode into privilege 
		(Note that:
			When Thread mode has been changed from privilege to use, it cannot change ifself back 
			to privilege. Only a handler can change the privilege of Thread mode.
			Handler mode is always privilege.
		)
		After call handler, get CONTROL[0] to check if it is truly privilege or not.
		If not, program will enter to error loop.
		
		We use two LED to display status of Thread mode.
		LED1: turn on if Thread mode is privilege.
		LED2: turn on if Thread mode is unprivilege.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
			2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- 3.3VA_E	:ON
				- VREG		:ON
				- IO_E		:ON
				- PWR_SEL	:depends on power source selection
		(Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
						
		UART configuration:
		1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- UART0: USB serial port
					+ All jumpers: Default
				- UART1: 
					+ P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
					+ P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
				- UART2:
					+ JP6: 	1-2: OFF
						3-4: OFF
						5-6: ON
					+ JP12: 1-2
					+ JP13: 1-2
					+ Other jumpers: Default
				- UART3:
					+ P0.2 (@J5.13) - JP12.2
					+ P0.3 (@J5.14) - JP13.2
				- UART4:
					+ P0.22 (@J3.25) - JP12.2
					+ P2.9 (@J3.15) - JP13.2
	    	2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- UART0: 
					All jumpers: optional
			
			Setting:
				+ 115200bps 
				+ 8 data bit 
				+ No parity 
				+ 1 stop bit 
				+ No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example and observe on serial display
					+ Press '1' to change into unprivilege mode
					+ Press '2' to switch back to privilege mode
