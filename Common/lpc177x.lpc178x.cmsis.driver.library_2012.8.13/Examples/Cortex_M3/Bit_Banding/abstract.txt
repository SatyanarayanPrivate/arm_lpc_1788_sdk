@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to test Bit-banding feature of Cortex-M3 processor
	Process:
		The processor memory map includes two bit-band regions. These occupy the lowest
		1MB of the SRAM and peripheral memory regions respectively.
		+ SRAM: 	Bit-band region: 	0x20000000 - 0x200FFFFF
					Bit-band alias:		0x22000000 - 0x23FFFFFF
		+ PERI:		Bit-band region:	0x40000000 - 0x400FFFFF
					Bit-band alias:		0x42000000 - 0x43FFFFFF
		The mapping formula:
				bit_word_offset = (byte_offset * 32) + (bit_number * 4)
				bit_word_address = bit_band_base + bit_word_offset
		where:
		+ bit_word_offset: the position of the target bit in the bit-band memory region
		+ bit_word_addr: the address of the word in the alias memory region that maps to the target bit
		+ bit_band_base: the starting address of the alias region
		+ byte_offset: the number of byte in the bit-band region that contains the targeted bit
		+ bit_number: is the bit position (0-7) of the targeted bit
		
		Note: In fact, the SRAM on LPC1788 just available in two ranges:
					+ 0x20000000 - 0x20007FFF: for on-chip SRAM
					+ 0x20098000 – 0x200980BF for GPIO registers
			  So, just can set 'VAR_ADDR' with value that exits in two ranges SRAM above.
		
		
		First, the program test SRAM bit-banding:
			+ read the value at VAR_ADDRESS
			Using bit-band access to:
			+ read the value at 'VAR_BIT'.
			+ clear the value at 'VAR_BIT' and print new value at VAR_ADDRESS 
			+ re-set the value at 'VAR_BIT' and print new value at VAR_ADDRESS
		Then, the program test PERIPHERAL bit-banding:
			+ Assigned value for PERI_ADDRESS
			Use bit-band access to:
			+ read the value at 'PERI_BIT'
			+ clear the value at 'PERI_BIT' and print new value at PERI_ADDRESS 
			+ re-set the value at 'PERI_BIT' and print new value at PERI_ADDRESS

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
			2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- 3.3VA_E	:ON
				- VREG		:ON
				- IO_E		:ON
				- PWR_SEL	:depends on power source selection
		(Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
						
		UART configuration:
		1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- UART0: USB serial port
					+ All jumpers: Default
				- UART1: 
					+ P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
					+ P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
				- UART2:
					+ JP6: 	1-2: OFF
						3-4: OFF
						5-6: ON
					+ JP12: 1-2
					+ JP13: 1-2
					+ Other jumpers: Default
				- UART3:
					+ P0.2 (@J5.13) - JP12.2
					+ P0.3 (@J5.14) - JP13.2
				- UART4:
					+ P0.22 (@J3.25) - JP12.2
					+ P2.9 (@J3.15) - JP13.2
	    	2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- UART0: 
					All jumpers: optional
			
			Setting:
				+ 115200bps 
				+ 8 data bit 
				+ No parity 
				+ 1 stop bit 
				+ No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example and observe result on serial display
