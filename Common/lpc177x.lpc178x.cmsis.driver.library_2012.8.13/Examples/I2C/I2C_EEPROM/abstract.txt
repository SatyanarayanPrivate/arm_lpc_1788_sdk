@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use I2C to drive EEPROM 24LC256
	Process:
		
		I2C is configured as master using polling mode to send/receive data.
		I2C Clock Rate is set at 200K.
		EEPROM Slave address is 0xA0 (8-bit format)
		After initialize and enable I2C, I2C writes 8 data to EEPROM at address: (0x0100)
		by using 'EEPROM_Write( )'function and then read back again these data from EEPROM
		After transmittion finished, read and write buffer will be compared, if not 
		familiar, the program will display an error message.

	eeprom_test.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
			Jumpers: Default

		This example does not work on the IAR board from Olimex because the EEPROM 24LC256
		is not mounted on
	
	Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- UART0: USB serial port
					+ All jumpers: Default
				- UART1: 
					+ P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
					+ P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
				- UART2:
					+ JP6: 	1-2: OFF
							3-4: OFF
							5-6: ON
					+ JP12: 1-2
					+ JP13: 1-2
					+ Other jumpers: Default
				- UART3:
					+ P0.2 (@J5.13) - JP12.2
					+ P0.3 (@J5.14) - JP13.2
				- UART4:
					+ P0.22 (@J3.25) - JP12.2
					+ P2.9  (@J3.15) - JP13.2
	    	2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- UART0: 
					All jumpers: optional
			Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
			
			Setting:
				+ 115200bps 
				+ 8 data bit 
				+ No parity 
				+ 1 stop bit 
				+ No flow control
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect desired UART on boards to COM ports on your computer.
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction. 
		- Step 5: Run example. Observe output on terminal.
