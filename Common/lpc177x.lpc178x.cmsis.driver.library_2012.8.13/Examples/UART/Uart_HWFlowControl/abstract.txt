@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use UART in hardware flow control mode
	Process:
		UART1 configuration:
			– 115200bps 
			– 8 data bit 
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– RTS/CTS flow control 
			- Receive and transmit enable
		
		UART will print welcome screen first, then:
		 	- press any key to have it read in from the terminal and returned back to the terminal.
			- Press ESC to exit.
			- Press 'r' to print welcome screen menu again.

	uart_hw_flow_control.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				Jumpers: Optional
							
		UART FullModem connection
				Because eval board does not wire all pins of UART1 to the COM1 port,
				the signal on CTS, RTS might be in incorrect state for UART1 running.
				
				** Using UART1 with Full Modem
					- P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
					- P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
					- P0.17 (@ J5.20) - JP11.10
                    - P0.22 (@ J3.25) - JP11.2
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
							
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect external board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example
				  Open PC terminal application, configure 
				  	- 115200bps, 
				  	- 8 databit 
				  	- no parity 
				  	- 1 stop bit 
				  	- hardware control
				  Type in some characters to see they displayed back on terminal screen.
