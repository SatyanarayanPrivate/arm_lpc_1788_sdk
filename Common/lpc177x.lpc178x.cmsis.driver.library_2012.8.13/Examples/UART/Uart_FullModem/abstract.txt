@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This is a simple UART example using UART Full modem mode.
	Process:
	 	Configure UART using the following settings:
	 		- Baudrate = 115200 bps
	 		- 8 data bit
	 		- 1 Stop bit
	 		- None parity

		After reset UART will send the welcome massage then start to receive the 
		character from PC and send back that character to PC.

	Uart_FullModem.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				Jumpers: Optional
							
		UART FullModem connection
				Because eval board does not wire all pins of UART1 to the COM1 port,
				the signal on CTS, RTS might be in incorrect state for UART1 running.
				In this case, CTS pin P0.17 must be pulled-low	

				** Using UART1 with Full Modem
					- P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
					- P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
					- P0.17 (@ J5.20 ) - GND
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
							
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART1 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Run example and using Serial display to see the result.
