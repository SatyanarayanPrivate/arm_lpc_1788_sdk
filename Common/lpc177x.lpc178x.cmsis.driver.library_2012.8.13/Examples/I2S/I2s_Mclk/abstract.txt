@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use I2S master clock as I2S clock source
	Process:
		I2S setup:
			- wordwidth: 16 bits
			- stereo mode
			- master mode for TX and slave mode for RX
			- ws_haftword = 31
			- frequency = 44.1Khz (maximum is 96kHz)
		I2S Clock setting:
			- Transmitter:
				+ Select the RX fractional rate divider clock ouput as the source
				+ Disable 4-wire mode
				+ Enable TX_MCLK output (this setting is optional, just used to observe 
				  this clock on oscilloscope)
			- Receiver:
				+ Select the TX_MCLK signal as RX_MCLK clock source
				+ Disable 4-wire mode
				+ Disable RX_MCLK output 
		Clock calculate formula:
			MCLK = I2S_freq * (bitrate + 1) 
			bitrate = channel * wordwidth - 1
		Ex: a 48 kHz sample rate for 16-bit stereo data will have master clock:
			MCLK = 48K * 16 * 2 = 1.536Mhz
		
		This example sets I2S receiver use MCLK from I2S transmitter. So we don't have to connect wire 
		between I2SRX_CLK and I2STX_CLK.
		I2S transmit data in interrupt mode. After finished, received and transmited buffer will be verified,
		the result will be print out serial display.		
		
		Pls note that because I2S is the protocol for audio data transfer, so sometime it has dummy data
		while FIFO transmit is empty. These data are not importance and they can be ignored when verify.

@How to run:
	This example was tested on:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP22: OFF
				- JP23: OFF
				- JP24: OFF
				- JP25: OFF
				- JP26: OFF
				- JP27: OFF
				(Note: These jumpers are near the speaker)
				Remain jumpers: Default
			2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- 3.3VA_E	:ON
				- VREG		:ON
				- IO_E		:ON
				- PWR_SEL	:depends on power source selection
		(Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
		
		I2S connection: (uses MCLK share inside): I2S-RX connects to I2S-TX as following:
				P0.5-I2SRX_WS  connects to P0.8-I2STX_WS
				P0.6-I2SRX_SDA connects to P0.9-I2STX_SDA				

			Pin-map
								OEM board			IAR board									
				I2SRX_WS		J5.16				EXT-5
				I2SRX_SDA		J3.18				EXT-6
				
				I2STX_WS		J3.19			  	EXT-8
				I2STX_SDA		J5.18			  	EXT-9
			
				
	Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- UART0: USB serial port
					+ All jumpers: Default
				- UART1: 
					+ P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
					+ P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
				- UART2:
					+ JP6: 	1-2: OFF
							3-4: OFF
							5-6: ON
					+ JP12: 1-2
					+ JP13: 1-2
					+ Other jumpers: Default
				- UART3:
					+ P0.2 (@J5.13) - JP12.2
					+ P0.3 (@J5.14) - JP13.2
				- UART4:
					+ P0.22 (@J3.25) - JP12.2
					+ P2.9  (@J3.15) - JP13.2
	    	2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- UART0: 
					All jumpers: optional
			Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
			
			Setting:
				+ 115200bps 
				+ 8 data bit 
				+ No parity 
				+ 1 stop bit 
				+ No flow control  
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example, observe data on serial display
