@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use Event Monitor/Recorder Block to
        track event occurs on input pins.
	Process:
		After initialize RTC, set current time for RTC with this value:
		06:45:00PM, 2012-01-01
		Using terminal, the system can be controlled to enter to Sleep Mode,
        Power Down mode or Deep Power Down mode. When an event occurs on an 
        input channel, an wake-up request/interrupt is generated. So, the system 
        will exit from these states.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
			2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- 3.3VA_E	:ON
				- VREG		:ON
				- IO_E		:ON
				- PWR_SEL	:depends on power source selection
		(Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)				
		
    	Event Input pins:
                Channel         Pin         EA          IAR
                0               P0.7        J5.17       EXT-7
                1               P0.8        J3.19       EXT-8
                2           	P0.9        J5.18       EXT-9
	Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- UART0: USB serial port
					+ All jumpers: Default
				- UART1: 
					+ P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
					+ P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
				- UART2:
					+ JP6: 	1-2: OFF
							3-4: OFF
							5-6: ON
					+ JP12: 1-2
					+ JP13: 1-2
					+ Other jumpers: Default
				- UART3:
					+ P0.2 (@J5.13) - JP12.2
					+ P0.3 (@J5.14) - JP13.2
				- UART4:
					+ P0.22 (@J3.25) - JP12.2
					+ P2.9  (@J3.15) - JP13.2
	    	2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- UART0: 
					All jumpers: optional
			Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
			
			Setting:
				+ 115200bps 
				+ 8 data bit 
				+ No parity 
				+ 1 stop bit 
				+ No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode) 
		- Step 3: Connect UART0\1\2 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example:
            - Press S to enter Sleep Mode.
            - Press P to enter Power Down Mode
            - Press D to enter Deep Power Down Mode.
            - Connect desired event input channel pin to GND/VCC to generate events.
