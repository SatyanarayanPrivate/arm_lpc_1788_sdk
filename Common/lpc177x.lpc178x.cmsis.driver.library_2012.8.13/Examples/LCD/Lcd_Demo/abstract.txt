@Example description:
	Purpose:
		  This example project describes how to test LCD module on LPC1788.		  
	Process:
		  There are some functions which this example supported. Update below macros to enable/disable the relevant 
		  functions. These macros are defined in lcd_config.h file.
		  - LOGO_DISPLAYED	: display an image at the center of the LCD. 
		  - TCS_USED	  	: use touch screen controller.
		  - ACCEL_SENSOR_USED	: use acceleration sensor to detect the board moves.
		  - PAINT_ON_SCREEN	: paint on screen when user touches on the LCD. This function only runs if TCS_USED is set.
		  Other configurations:
		  - LOGO_BPP		: Defined in logo.h file. It determines the BPP used. This example tested with 2bpp, 16bpp and 24bpp.  
		  				In case "7 inch TFT (800x480) rev PB1" is used, please don't set it as 24.
		  Steps in the example:
		  - Display the LOGO on screen.
		  - Display the cursor at the center of the LCD.
		  - Get the next cursor position using touch sensor or acceleration sensor.
		  - Move the cursor to the above position.
		  					  
		  Besides, the backlight of LCD can be adjust by turn left/right potentiometer.


@Directory contents:
	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files	
	 
	\app: Include main file, logo & cursor image
	\board: board config file
	\modules: include supported drivers for this example 
	
@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
               Connect OEM Base Board with "QVGA TFT LCD (320x240)" or "EA LCD board, 7 inch TFT (800x480) rev PB1."
			2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- 3.3VA_E	:ON
				- VREG		:ON
				- IO_E		:ON
				- PWR_SEL	:depends on power source selection
		(Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
						
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
				
Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Run example, observe LCD display
		- Step 5: In case QVGA is used, touch on screen and observe the cursor moves.
		
		@Warning: Maybe J-LINK power source cannot supply enough power for LCD
