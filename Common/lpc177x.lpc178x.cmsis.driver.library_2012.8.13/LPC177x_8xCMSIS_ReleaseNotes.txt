RELEASE LPC177x_8xCMSIS_120731

***** Implementations and Improvements ****
1. Update MCI Driver and examples:
    + SDHC card support.
          - Use block address for read/write commands in case the SDHC/SDXC card is being plugged.
          - Increase timeout value which is set to MCIDataTimer register.
    + Change the parameter of MCI_Set_MCIClock function: inputs SD Clock Output Frequency.
    + Update MCI_SetCardAddress function: after CMD3 is sent, enter to push-pull mode. 
    + Add delay 3MCLK + 2PCLK after writing to CLOCK, POWER, COMMAND & DATACTRL register.
    + Update MCI_Init function: add a long delay before entering to power-on phase.
    + Update MCI_SendCmd function:  
          - Clear status register before setting a command.
          - After setting a command, wait until command is sent.
    + Update MCI_GetCmdResp function:
          - In case of EXPECT_SHORT_RESP, only update the first integer entry of CmdResp argument.
    + Update MCI_Acmd_SendOpCond function:
          -  Increase the number of retry from 0x200 to 0x2000.
          -  If the sending of CMD55 failed (after some retries), return immediately.
    + Update MCI_SetBusWidth function:
          - Only send bus width command if the card isn't MMC card.
          - The argument for bus width command relevant to input argument. 
    + Update functions which sends a command to the card
          - Check the current card state before and after a command is executed to make sure 
		the command is executed successfully .
          - After receiving the relevant response, check if any error bit in the card status is set. 
		If yes, return with MCI_FUNC_BAD_PARAMETERS error.
    + Update card status check:
          - Update MCI_GetCardStatus function: Get the card status and return regardless of the busy bit status.
          - Update MCI_CheckStatus function: Add 1 argument to input the expected card state.
                
2. Update I2C driver:
   + Clear the STA bit after writing the slave address. 
   + Clear all bit of CONSET register in I2C_DeInit function. 
   + After receiving ACK for SLA+R, AA bit of CONSET register only be set if the expected receive length > 1.
   + After master sends all data, it sends REPEAT START (instead of sending STOP and then START bit) to receive 
         data from slave. 
   + Update I2C_Start & I2C_Stop function:
         - Add an argument to select the mode. 
         - In polling mode, it will wait until the START/STOP is sent.
         - In interrupt mode, the function exits after the relevant bit of CONSET register is set.
   + Use I2C_Start function if master needs to send START bit.

      + Add define CLKPWR_CLKTYPE_SPIFI   
      + Remove CLKPWR_GetCLKSEL() function
    - lpc178x_pinsel.h
      + Remove two functions: PINSEL_SetAnalogPinMode() and PINSEL_DacEnable() 
    - lpc178x_adc.c
      + Fix bug in ADC_Init() function
    - lpc178x_clkpwr.c
      + Modify functions: 
        . CLKPWR_SetCLKDiv()
        . CLKPWR_GetCLK()
    - lpc178x_dac.c
      + Modify DAC_Init() function
    - lpc178x_pinsel.c
      + Modify this function to compatible with new silicon
    - lpc178x_systick.c
      + Modify SYSTICK_Init() function
4./ Examples:
    - Add IAR project and configuration files in each example
    - Update abstract files
    - ADC examples: Change code to run ADC at 400KHz instead of 200KHz
    - GPIO\Gpio_LedBlinky: not use SystemFrequency variable
    - NVIC\Nvic_VectorTableRelocation: 
      + use define __RAM_MODE__
      + Reduce Systick time interval to 100ms (maximum is 174ms)
    - PWR\Pwr_PowerDown:
      + Remove disable and disconnect main PLL) part
    - USB/Usb_MassStorage/usbhw.c
      + Update to compile with IAR compiler
    - USB/Usb_VirtualCom
      + Modify these files to compile with IAR compiler & compatible with new chip
        . cdcuser.h
        . serial.c
        . serial.h
        . usbcore.c
        . usbhw.c
        . vcomdemo.c
5./ Add folder /linker (placed at ../Core/CM3/DeviceSupport/NXP/LPC178x/linker.
    It contains two linker files (for ROM & RAM) for IAR project
