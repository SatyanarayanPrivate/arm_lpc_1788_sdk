@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to write a simple USB Mass Storage application on LPC177x_8x.
	Process:
		The MassStorage project is a Mass Storage simple demo run on LPC177x_8x		                                                
		
		It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.		
		The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
		running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				Use USB mini port J19
				- JP15: ON (near J19)
				- JP16: ON (near J19)
				- Other jumpers: Default
			2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- 3.3VA_E	:ON
				- VREG		:ON
				- 3.3V_IO_E	:ON
				- PWR_SEL	:depends on power source selection
		(Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
	
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Hit reset button to run example.
		- Step 5: After see UGL(USB Good Link). Open My Computer, you will see 'LPC177x_8x' disk.
		- Step 6: Open this disk, you will see 'Readme.txt' file (it has read-only attribute)
		- Step 7: Try to copy/delete another file into disk to test if Mass Storage is work well or not
